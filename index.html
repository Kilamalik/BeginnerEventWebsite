                <p>12 Day Mindfulness and Yoga Retreat in Sri Lanka

                Mindfulness has such a positive impact on both our physical and mental well-being. It is also true, that to feel the greatest benefit, we need to develop a regular practice. In our busy lives, it is difficult to devote the time necessary to do this.
                   
                One of the best ways to strengthen our learning and improve our practice is to join a retreat.</p>
